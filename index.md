Xanthan is a simple website template that makes it easy to share humanities work online in an open and sustainable way. Your digital projects can be hosted for free, always accessible, easy to update, and remain available until you decide otherwise.

At its core, Xanthan supports creative approaches to scholarship and teaching. It includes features for digital storytelling---such as a StoryMap-style interface---that invite you to present research in ways that are visually engaging and intellectually compelling.

Unlike commercial platforms such as Wix or Squarespace, Xanthan emphasizes openness and durability over quick customization. Updating your site takes a little more attention to detail, but you donâ€™t need any technical background to get started. 

The goal is to provide a gentle path into digital publishing that foregrounds design and storytelling as essential tools for communicating about the humanities.

For more information about your site works, see the `Website Guides` tab.

For more on adding features to your pages, see the documentation under the `Page Components` tab.
